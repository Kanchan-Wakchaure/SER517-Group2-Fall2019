I assume you have latest python, pip and node installed.
To run the server:
---------------------------

Go to command prompt and run the following command.

pip install django

pip install djongo

pip install dnspython

python manage.py makemigrations travlendar_app

python manage.py migrate

[p.s dont commit local migrations file to git.]

pip install django-cors-headers

pip install restframework


Create a txt file and give its name secretkey.txt. I will send the file seperately. It contains the secretkey.Keep that where manage.py resides.

Goto the directory which has manage.py in cmd.

Run-> python manage.py runserver

Goto http://127.0.0.1:8000/  to check if server running.


To run frontend:
---------------------------------
Disable virtualenv if was enabled before.(command ->deactivate)

go to frontend folder.

npm install react-scripts

npm install axios --save

npm install --save react-router-dom

npm start

This will start react on localhost:3000


P.s-> Install any other dependencies if server says so.
